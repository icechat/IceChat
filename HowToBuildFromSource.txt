Unzip the file into any folder. It is best to use My Documents and not the Program Files folder, because of permissions issues.

There is an BuildIceChat.cmd file in the root folder which will build IceChat 9.

If you have a problem with BuildIceChat.cmd erroring about msbuild, try BuildIceChat.4.0.cmd

If you want to build IceChat using .Net 4 Framework, use BuildIceChat.4.5.cmd


Open a command line window (cmd.exe) and run the BuildIceChat.cmd at the prompt.
A new folder called IceChatBuild will be created, and once the batch file has completed, 4 files will be placed in this folder.

Copy these 4 files into your IceChat installation/Program Files folder, or place them anywhere else you want.

To see all the changes from build to build, read the changelog.txt file in the source code.
